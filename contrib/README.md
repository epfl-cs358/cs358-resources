# How to contribute

If you have an artifact that you want to contribute, first decide of what kind it is -- CAD, code, or combined  solution. Do not contribute your entire team project -- for this your have your dedicated repo, to which we will link from here.

It does make sense to first ask the course staff how we think about you contributing a specific artifact, before you put work into polishing your submission, though this is not strictly required.

Create a directory with a descriptive name not used for an artifact in this repository yet, and add your files. Your entire contribution should be inside a single directory (which of course may have subdirectories). Include a README.md descriping your artifact and what to do, and credit yourself and your co-creators.
Try to make your contribution as clean, robust, and useful as possible. We may reject a submission that is too preliminary (though you can re-submit after fixing the weaknesses).

Fork this repo, add your directory to the fitting subdirectory of contrib (cad, code, or solution), and create a pull request. Do not add your contributions to top-level directories other than contrib. We may move your directory to a suitable top-level directory later. 

For CAD contributions, we ask that you provide a Fusion360 archive (.f3d/.f3z) file AND a .step file. If your parts are to be 3d-printed, please also provide .stl files. For a design to be laser-cut, please also provide .dxf files.

We reserve the right to modify or delete your contribution later. Typically, we expect this to happen when a component you rely upon is not made anymore and cannot easily be substituted. We may allow future students to improve upon your articfact and credit themselves as co-author. While your contribution is in the repo, you will be credited as author.
