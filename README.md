# cs358-resources

This repository has been created for students taking the course CS358 Making Intelligent Things at EPFL. Anybody may use these resources -- see the LICENSE.

This repository is for sharing files that may be useful to you in your EPFL CS358 projects, particularly CAD designs and code, but also entire solutions to specific problems, which may combine electronics designs, code, bills of materials, and CAD files.

Some of these artifacts have been created by the course staff, but students taking the course are invited to contribute.


## How to contribute

If you have an artifact you want to contribute, first decide of what kind it is -- CAD, code, or combined  solution. Do not contribute your entire team project -- for this your have your dedicated repo, to which we will link from here.

It does make sense to first ask the course staff how we think about you contributing a specific artifact, before you put work into polishing your submission, though this is not strictly required.

Create a directory with a descriptive name not used for an artifact in this repository yet, and your files. Include a README.md descriping your artifact and what to do, and credit yourself and your co-creators.
Try to make your contribution as clean, robust, and useful as possible. We may reject a submission that is too preliminary (though you can re-submit after fixing the weaknesses).

Fork this repo, add your directory to the fitting subdirectory of contrib (cad, code, or solution), and create a pull request. Do noit add your contributions to top-level directories other than contrib. We may move your directory to a suitable top-level directory later. 

We reserve the right to modify or delete your contribution later. Typically, we expect this to happen when a component you rely upon is not made anymore and cannot easily be substituted. We may allow future students improve upon your articfact. While your contribution is in the repo, you will be credited as author.
