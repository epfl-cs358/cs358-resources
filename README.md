# cs358-resources

This repository has been created for students taking the course CS358 Making Intelligent Things at EPFL. Anybody may use these resources -- see the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

This repository is for sharing files that may be useful to you in your EPFL CS358 projects, particularly CAD designs and code, but also entire solutions to specific problems, which may combine electronics designs, code, bills of materials, and CAD files.

Some of these artifacts have been created by the course staff, but students taking the course are invited to contribute.
